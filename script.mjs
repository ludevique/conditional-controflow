//let's start by having the total capacity of the garden.

// in other to have it we should make an operation that gives us the answer.

//we have a total plants of 20 which takes a min of 0.8 meters
//let's know how much space 20 plants will take accorrding to their spaces eacch

let space = 20 / 0.64
console.log(space)
console.log(`20 plants will occupied ${space} of the capacity`)
//we already know they double each week

//we have a total space of 78.53 and 20 plants takes up to 31.25 of the space.therefore let's see how much we have after.

let remain = 78.53 - 31.25
console.log(remain)
